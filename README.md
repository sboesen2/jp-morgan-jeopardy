# J.P. Morgan Jeopardy

Welcome to the **J.P. Morgan Jeopardy** repository! This project helps you (and your friends) practice essential finance knowledge, J.P. Morgan trivia, interview tips, and more—**all in a classic Jeopardy-style game**.

## What’s in This Repo

1. **`README.md` (this file):**  
   - Overview of the game  
   - Quick instructions on how to use the repository

2. **[`game.md`](./game.md):**  
   - Contains the **full Jeopardy board** with 6 categories and point values (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000).  
   - Each clue (“Answer”) is visible immediately.  
   - Each correct response (“Question”) is hidden inside a **collapsible section**, so you won’t see the answer until you click **“Show the Correct Response”**.

## How to Play

1. **Open the `game.md` file** in this repository.  
2. You’ll see a table with **6 categories** (Banking Basics, J.P. Morgan & Culture, Financial Market Concepts, Interview Tips, Tech & Innovations, and Random Trivia) across the top, and point values (200–1000) down the left column.  
3. **Click a link** (e.g., “BB-200” for Banking Basics 200). GitHub will scroll to that clue.  
4. **Read the “Answer”**: In Jeopardy format, that’s the clue you must respond to.  
5. **Make Your Guess**: Formulate your response as “What is…?” or “Who is…?”  
6. **Check** the hidden “Question”: Click **“Show the Correct Response”** under the clue’s `<details>` section.  
7. **Go Back to the Board**: Click the `[Back to Board](#j-p-morgan-jeopardy-board)` link to pick another clue.  
8. **Keep Score**: Use a notepad, spreadsheet, or mental tally.

## Final Jeopardy

- At the bottom of `game.md`, you’ll find **Final Jeopardy** clues. Players can wager some (or all) of their points. Then reveal the correct response once everyone’s locked in an answer.

## Why This Game?

- **Interview Prep**: Learn more about J.P. Morgan’s history, values, and culture—helpful for internships, interviews, or simply expanding your industry knowledge.  
- **Finance Fundamentals**: Categories like Banking Basics and Financial Market Concepts will help you sharpen your skills.  
- **Fun & Interactive**: The Jeopardy format turns boring memorization into a quiz game—ideal for study groups or personal review.  
- **Spoiler-Free Answers**: By using collapsible sections, players won’t accidentally see the correct response too soon.

## Customizing

- **Add/Edit Categories**: Fork the repo or open a pull request with new questions and answers.  
- **Change Point Values**: If you want fewer (or more) levels, tweak the board accordingly.  
- **Upgrade the Format**: If you prefer a PowerPoint or a hosted site, you can adapt these questions. The content here is yours to remix!
