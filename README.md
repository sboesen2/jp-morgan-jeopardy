# J.P. Morgan Jeopardy Game

Welcome to the **J.P. Morgan Jeopardy** project! This repository helps you (or a friend) practice essential finance, technical, and cultural knowledge about J.P. Morgan in a fun, Jeopardy-style format.

## How This Repository Works

1. **README.md (this file):** Provides a quick overview, instructions, and the purpose of the project.
2. **game.md (coming soon):** Will contain the **fully clickable Jeopardy board** and all the Q&A pairs (clues and correct responses).

## Objectives

- **Test Knowledge**: Brush up on finance fundamentals, J.P. Morgan trivia, interview tips, and more.
- **Interactive Format**: Use the clickable Jeopardy board to jump between questions and categories.
- **Self-Study or Group Fun**: You can play solo or with friends. Just keep track of points on paper, or discuss answers together.

## Planned Features

- **Clickable Links**: Our `game.md` file will feature a table with categories and point values, each linking to the correct question-answer pair.
- **Easy Navigation**: Each clue includes a “back to board” link or anchor, so you can quickly return and pick another category.
- **Expansion**: You can fork this repository and add your own categories, or edit existing ones, to tailor the game to your needs.

## How to Play (Overview)

1. **Open the Game**: Once the `game.md` file is uploaded, click on it here in GitHub to view the rendered Markdown.
2. **Pick a Category & Point Value**: For example, “Banking Basics for 400.”
3. **Click the Link**: GitHub will jump you straight to that clue.
4. **Read the Clue**: The “Answer” appears, and the player must respond in the form of a question (“What is…” / “Who is…”).
5. **Check the Correct Response**: The same section (or a hidden text) will show you the official “Question” (correct answer).
6. **Return to the Board**: Click the provided link to go back to the table of categories and choose another one.
7. **Track Points**: Use a notepad or whiteboard to track each player’s score.

## Next Steps

- We will create a new file, `game.md`, that has:
  - A **6x6 board** (6 categories, each with 5 point values, plus Final Jeopardy).
  - All the “answers” (clues) and “questions” (correct responses).
  - Proper anchor links so the table links to the correct sections.

Stay tuned!
